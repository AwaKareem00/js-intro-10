debugging: trouble shooting the program to find issues, logic errors etc. 

escape sequences: 
\' insert a single qupte
\" insert a double quote
\\ insert a backward slash 
\t insert a tab space
\n insert a new line

with ES6, js added with backticks which provides temolate literals these backtiks 

`   hello,

    today is saturday and we are here to learn more
about 'javascripr' and its data types.

// sinlge line comments

Variables: 
special containers used to tore data and these variables can be accessed later in your progra,.

syntax: Initialization
var variableName = value;
let variableName = value;
const VariableName = value;

Declaration:
var variableName; // undefined
let variableName; // undefined

assigment 
VariableName = value;

re-assigment;
variableName = value;

DATA TYPES:

primitive types: basic types that ussualy tores a peice of info
7 primitives:
stringnumber: text
BigInt: number
Boolean: true or false
undefined: 
null:
symbol: 

refernce types: complex types whoch can store more information
arrays, maps



1. String: a sequence of characters (zero, one or multiple chacraters)
    we store strings in single or double quotes
    let name = 'john';
    let city = 'chicago';

    ''      -> empty string
    ' '     -> string 
    '123'   -> string
    'undefined -> string
    'null' -> string

2. number: is used to store all absolute and decimal numbers (8 bytes)
Whole NUmbers; absolute numbers: 1, 2, 10, 25, 100
Decimal numbers; floating numbers: 2.5, 10.99, 13.756934643


3. BigInt: used to store larger number (more than 8 bytes)




= vs == vs ===
=        assignment operator
==       comparison operator (loose)
===      comparison operator (strict)

3 == 3    -> true
3 == '3'  -> true ( it checks the value only not the data type)
3 === '3' -> flase ( it checls both the value and the data type)

'5' === 'five'   -> false 
'5' === '50'     -> false
'5' === '5'      -> true


deprecation
var is a reserved key word but it might get depricated in the future as we use let and comst now


undefined vs null
undefined is the default type when you feclare a variable but do not provide any value
null is speccially a stating that this variable holds no value

type pf undefined will return undefined 
typeof null return pbject

let laptopModel; 




ZIPCODE: "12345 1234", "1234 123", "12345 -1234"
PHONE: "000.000.0000", "000 000 0000", "(000) 000-0000"


Object data type is used to store key-value pairs, properties
firstName -> 'john'
lastName -> 'doe'
age -> 25
phonenumber -> '000 000-0000'
email -> ;johndoe@gmail.com
password - 'johndoe1234'
